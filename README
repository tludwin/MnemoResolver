Main goal of the project is to help memorizing digits, i.e. PINs, credit card or phone numbers.
The algorithm is based on idea (no, not mine) of assigning consonant(s) to each digit and then trying to figure what word(s) contain those letters. 
Example: 
1. End user's input is: 4284401
2. Input can be mapped to: "rnfrrst" out of which:
3. "run forrest!" can be formed.
